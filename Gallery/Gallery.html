    <h1>SOME LANDMARKS OF PAKISTAN </h1>
    <P>
        Pakistan is a multi-ethnic country in South Asia bordered by Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest,
        China to the northeast, and India to the east. Pakistan has been governed by different rulers throughout
        history, from the nature-loving Mughal Emperors to the British colonialists. The culture, food, and religion are
        influenced by a range of ethnic groups, such as Punjabis, Kashmiris, Sindhis, Muhajirs (the descendants of
        Indian immigrants) and tribal communities. <br>

        The country has fantastic archaeological sites, mausoleums, lush green landscapes and impressive mountain peaks,
        so there’s a varied range of landmarks in Pakistan to see. From mosques and forts to national parks, these
        Pakistan landmarks will give you a taste of the country’s architectural, artistic, and natural beauty.
