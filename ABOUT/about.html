        Pakistan (Urdu: پاکِستان [ˈpaːkɪstaːn]),[d] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (اِسلامی جمہوریہ
        پاکِستان),
        is a country in South Asia. It is the world's fifth-most populous country, with a population of almost 243
        million
        people, and has the world's second-largest Muslim population just behind Indonesia.[15] Pakistan is the
        33rd-largest
        country in the world by area and 2nd largest in South Asia, spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square
        miles). It has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south, and
        is
        bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China to the northeast. It is
        separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime
        border
        with Oman. Islamabad is the nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial centre. <br>

        Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in
        Balochistan,[16] the Indus Valley civilisation of the Bronze Age, the most extensive of the civilisations of the
        Afro-Eurasia,[17][18] and the ancient Gandhara civilization.[19] The region that comprises the modern state of
        Pakistan was the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid; briefly that of Alexander
        the
        Great; the Seleucid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta;[20] the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the
        Hindu
        Shahis, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals,[21] the Durranis, the Omani Empire, the Sikh Empire,
        British East India Company rule, and most recently, the British Indian Empire from 1858 to 1947. <br>

        Spurred by the Pakistan Movement, which sought a homeland for the Muslims of British India, and election
        victories
        in 1946 by the All-India Muslim League, Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the Partition of the British
        Indian Empire, which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and was accompanied by an
        unparalleled mass migration and loss of life. Initially a Dominion of the British Commonwealth, Pakistan
        officially drafted its constitution in 1956, and emerged as a declared Islamic republic. In 1971, the exclave of
        East Pakistan seceded as the new country of Bangladesh after a nine-month-long civil war. In the following four
        decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments whose descriptions, although complex, commonly alternated
        between
        civilian and military, democratic and authoritarian, relatively secular and Islamist. Pakistan elected a
        civilian government in 2008, and in 2010 adopted a parliamentary system with periodic elections. <br>

        Pakistan is a middle power nation, and has the world's sixth-largest standing armed forces.
        It is a declared nuclear-weapons state, and is ranked amongst the emerging and growth-leading economies,[31]
        with a
        large and rapidly-growing middle class.[32] Pakistan's political history since independence has been
        characterised
        by periods of significant economic and military growth as well as those of political and economic instability.
        It is
        an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. The country
        continues to face challenges, including poverty, illiteracy, corruption and terrorism.[33] Pakistan is a member
        of
        the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the
        Commonwealth
        of Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and the Islamic Military Counter-Terrorism
        Coalition, and is designated as a major non-NATO ally by the United <br>

            <h2 id="etm">Etymology</h2>
        </li>
        The name Pakistan was coined by Choudhry Rahmat Ali, a Pakistan Movement activist, who in January 1933 first
        published it in a pamphlet Now or Never, using it as an acronym.[34] Rahmat Ali explained: <ins>"It is composed
            of
            letters taken from the names of all our homelands, Indian and Asian, Panjab, Afghania, Kashmir, Sindh
            (including
            Kutch and Kathiawar), and Baluchistan."</ins> He added that "Pakistan is both a Persian and Urdu word... It
        means the land
        of the Paks, the spiritually pure and clean."[35] Etymologists note that پاک pāk, is 'pure' in Persian and
        Pashto[36] and the Persian suffix ـستان -stan means 'land' or 'place of'.<br>
        Rahmat Ali’s concept of Pakistan only related to the north-west area of the Indian subcontinent. He also
        proposed
        the name "Banglastan" for the Muslim areas of Bengal and "Osmanistan" for Hyderabad State, as well as a
        political
        federation between the three</p>

        <p>
            Predominantly Muslims, the people of Pakistan are culturally homogeneous. Other religious groups include the
            Christians, Buddhist, Hindus and Parsees. All belong to a composite racial stock although the majority
            belongs
            to an Aryan extraction. While Urdu, the national language, is spoken throughout Pakistan, English is
            extensively
            used in official and commercial circles, and in the cities. The regional languages are Sindhi in Sindh,
            Balochi
            in Baluchistan, Punjabi in Punjab and Pashto in the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP).

            <h2 id="geo">Geography</h2>
        </li>
        <p>
            Pakistan has a total area of 803,940 square kilometers, slightly greater than France and the United Kingdom
            put
            together.

            Pakistan is located in South Asia. To the south is the Arabian Sea, with 1,046 km of Pakistani coastline. To
            Pakistan’s east is India, which has a 2,912 km border with Pakistan. To its west is Iran, which has a 909 km
            border with Pakistan. To Pakistan’s northwest lies Afghanistan, with a shared border of 2,430 km. China is
            towards the northeast and has a 523 km border with Pakistan.

            The main waterway of Pakistan is the Indus River that begins in China, and runs nearly the entire length of
            Pakistan, flowing through all of Pakistan’s provinces except Balochistan. is fed by the combined waters of
            three
            of the five rivers of Punjab the Chenab, Jhelum, and Ravi. The waters of the other two rivers, the Beas and
            the
            Sutlej, are largely withdrawn for irrigation in India. Along the Indus and its tributaries are found most of
            Pakistan’s population, its chief agricultural areas, and its major hydroelectric power stations,
            interconnected
            by the world’s largest system of agricultural canals, join the Indus before it discharges into the Arabian
            Sea.

            The northern and western areas of Pakistan are mountainous. Pakistani administered areas of Kashmir contain
            some
            of the highest mountains in the world, including the second tallest, K-2. Northern Pakistan tends to receive
            more rainfall than the southern parts of the country, and has some areas of preserved moist temperate
            forest. In
            the southeast, Pakistan’s border with India passes through a flat desert, called the Cholistan or Thal
            Desert.
            West-central Baluchistan has a high desert plateau, bordered by low mountain ranges. Most of the Punjab, and
            parts of Sindh, are fertile plains where agriculture is of great importance

            <h2 id="history">History of Pakistan</h2>
        </li>
        <p>Pakistan emerged on the world map as an independent sovereign state in August 1947, as a result of the
            division of the British Indian Empire. With a land area of 796,095 sq. km. [including FATA (Federal
            Administered Tribal Areas) and FANA (Federal Administered Northern Areas)], its population stands at nearly
            172.80 million, according to the 2008 Census. Historically, this is one of the most ancient lands known to
            man. Its cities flourished before Babylon was built; its people practiced the art of good living and
            citizenship before the celebrated ancient Greeks. <br>

            The region traces its history back to at least 2,500 years before Christ, when a highly developed
            civilization flourished in the Indus Valley. Excavations at Harappa, Mohenjodaro and Kot Diji have brought
            to light evidence of an advanced civilization flourishing here even in most ancient times. Around 1,500 B.C.
            the Aryans conquered this region and slowly pushed the Hindu inhabitants further east, towards the Ganges
            Valley. Later, the Persians occupied the northern regions in 5th century B.C. The Greeks came in 327 B.C.,
            under Alexander of Macedonia, and ran through the region like a meteor. In 712 A.D. the Arabs, led by
            Mohammed Bin Qasim, landed somewhere near what is now Karachi, and ruled the lower half of Pakistan for two
            hundred years. During this time Islam took root and influenced the life, culture and traditions of the
            inhabitants of the region. <br>

            From 10th century A.D. onwards, a systematic conquest of Indo-Pakistan by the Muslims from Central Asia
            began and lasted up to 18th century A.D., when the British colonized the Sub-continent and ruled for nearly
            200 years (for 100 years over what is now Pakistan). The Muslim revival began towards the end of the last
            century when Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, a renowned leader and educationist, launched a movement for intellectual
            renaissance of the Indian Muslims. In 1930, the well-known poet/philosopher, Dr. Mohammed Iqbal conceived
            the idea of a separate state for the Muslims of the Sub-continent, and in 1940, the All-India Muslim League
            adopted the famous Pakistan Resolution. <br>

            After seven years of untiring struggle, under the brilliant leadership of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah,
            Pakistan emerged on the world map as a sovereign state on August 14, 1947, when the British Indian Empire
            was partitioned into two independent states – India and Pakistan.</p>

        <p>
            Pakistan has been the cradle of a civilization that dates back more than five millennium. Over the
            centuries, through successive waves of migrations from the north-west, as well as by internal migrations
            across the subcontinent, Aryans, Persians, Greeks, Arabs, and Mughals came and settled in this region.
            However, it was Islam and Islamic traditions that finally took roots and formed the mainspring of Pakistan’s
            cultural heritage. <br>

            Muslims from the earliest days, built cities, forts, palaces, mosques, madras’s (religious schools), tombs
            and mausoleums which are marked by simplicity and grandeur, with open spaces and abundance of light in
            accordance with the Islamic concept of man’s direct and open relationship with the Creator. Pakistan
            inherits immense treasure of culture, and the government is trying its best to preserve and promote this
            cultural treasure. There are several government agencies such as Pakistan National Council of Arts, Lok
            Virsa (Folk Heritage), National Film Development Corporation, Authority for Preservation of Mohenjo-Daro and
            National Archives of Pakistan, each to perform a given set of functions in this area.

            Pakistan has every reason to be proud of the thousands of years old and rich tradition of its arts and
            crafts. In the post-independence period, the successive governments have been providing substantial state
            help and initiative for the uplift of arts and crafts in the country. A wider recognition of the
            accomplishments of crafts-people has been facilitated by the activities of the National Crafts Council and
            promotional plans of organizations such as the Export Promotion Bureau and Small Industries Corporations.
            Pakistani craftsmen are well reputed in producing quality products in clay, stone, fabrics, carpets, wood,
            metal, jewelry and leather.

        <p>
            Pakistan is important for many religions of the world. The Indus Valley gave rise to one of the first great
            civilizations. Mahayana Buddhism also developed here as did the Sikh religion under Guru Nanak. Pakistan was
            created in the Indus Valley specifically to provide the Muslims of South Asia with a state of their own, and
            there are very few countries where religion plays such an important role in the lives of people. <br>

            Muslims make up over 98% of the population of Pakistan, of which roughly 80% are Sunni and 20 % are Sh’iah.
            About 1 % of the population is Christian with slightly more Protestants than Catholics. The Hindus, mostly
            nomads living in the South account for less than 1%. In Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and Quetta there are
            small communities of Buddhists and there are a tiny group of animist Kalash living in Chitral on the Afghan
            border.
